2021-11-24 08:31:05 UTC,I don't tweet about Boba that much because the community annoyed the hell out of me already with their incessant shilling and also it's a modified fork of Optimism so it's less interesting to me than the other rollups.  Fwiw I only have advisor bags for Polygon!,sassal0x,[],[],0,14,3
2021-11-19 10:12:17 UTC,Sir I've been an advisor to Polygon since January and have talked about them extensively since then ðŸ˜…,sassal0x,[],[],0,65,4
2021-11-19 09:16:40 UTC,If you still think that the  ecosystem is just the PoS chain then you're ngmi.  - Hermez (ZK) - Miden (ZK) - Nightfall (private ZK/ORU) - Avail (DA chain) - Polygon SDK (dev tooling)  Remember these names as they will be at the forefront of Ethereum's scaling journey.,sassal0x,[],[],247,1332,81
2021-11-04 07:43:50 UTC,"Well, it'll be happening on Ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem which is secured by Ethereum   X is already making a lot of waves here and there are others coming too  There's also the Polygon ecosystem which has a lot of stuff happening",sassal0x,[],[],0,84,5
2021-11-03 01:48:31 UTC,A world of scalability solutions awaits you:  https://t.co/3AR146ONGs  And also the Polygon PoS chain,sassal0x,[],[],5,117,1
2021-11-02 06:08:18 UTC,For EVM-compatible layer 2's like Arbitrum and Optimism it's pretty easy  Immutable X uses different tech (StarkWare's StarkEx) so it requires a more involved approach  OpenSea is also on the Polygon PoS chain,sassal0x,[],[],0,4,0
2021-10-25 07:47:55 UTC,My take (thread) - note that I am an advisor to Polygon   https://t.co/PeOh7H1HDs,sassal0x,[],[],2,26,2
2021-10-15 13:39:04 UTC,You can actually use the 'Swap for Gas' service to swap any of the supported tokens for MATIC (without needing MATIC for fees).   https://t.co/uLYckVX66Q,sassal0x,[],[],0,18,1
2021-10-07 06:40:25 UTC,Polygon is more than just the PoS chain - they have a suit of solutions such as Polygon Avail (data availability chain) and Polygon Hermez (zk rollup).,sassal0x,[],[],0,5,1
2021-10-06 11:10:12 UTC,Polygon's growth has continued even though most of the rewards have subsided - the PoS chain has product/market fit for people who can't afford layer 1 Ethereum,sassal0x,[],[],0,10,1
2021-09-26 13:51:08 UTC,"I asked you to name which apps actually need a not-so-decentralized chain?  The Polygon PoS chain (and pretty much every other EVM-chain) sacrifices decentralization to give users cheap fees.  Medium/longer-term we don't need to do this because of L2's - again, you know this.",sassal0x,[],[],0,4,1
2021-09-26 13:47:59 UTC,You know why I support Polygon - I've explained it on Twitter and in DMs to you - but here's my thread in case you haven't seen it.   https://t.co/9ceoFvbVsi,sassal0x,[],[],0,2,2
2021-09-17 09:36:27 UTC,I literally cannot wait sir - future is very bright for Polygon :),sassal0x,[],[],1,39,1
2021-09-17 09:24:42 UTC,Polygon's consistent growth on the PoS chain is quite a sight to behold.   https://t.co/36N70g2qR8,sassal0x,[],[],31,180,7
2021-09-15 09:41:40 UTC,Told ya'll that  really is just at the beginning of their journey.  So many products already live with more being announced/launched all the time.  Polygon is an Ethereum scaling powerhouse.   https://t.co/6Zi4va45Hk,sassal0x,[],[],64,342,11
2021-09-13 08:12:27 UTC,Love Polygon but it's not really an apples to apples comparison.  Arbitrum has only been live for 12 days and accounts for $2.2bil of that TVL.,sassal0x,[],[],0,0,1
2021-09-12 16:04:42 UTC,Ethereum.  Arbitrum Optimism Polygon StarkWare Matter Labs Loopring Aztec Fuel Labs Connext Hop Protocol Celer Network  Ethereum.,sassal0x,[],[],179,1582,137
2021-09-12 12:52:06 UTC,Polygon are one of the true pioneers in this area for sure,sassal0x,[],[],0,11,1
2021-09-12 02:28:45 UTC,It's up to their team to deploy it but they've already announced support for Immutable X and are already live on the Polygon PoS chain,sassal0x,[],[],0,5,1
2021-09-05 14:41:30 UTC,Roadmaps are always hard in this industry but afaik OpenSea has already committed to deploying on Immutable X and also the Polygon PoS chain.,sassal0x,[],[],0,4,6
2021-09-05 13:02:08 UTC,The  ecosystem is pretty amazing.  - PoS chain (live w/ $5.3bil TVL) - Polygon SDK (live for devs to use) -  (live zkRollup on Ethereum) - Polygon Avail (devnet) - $1bil+ committed to zero knowledge research  And this is just the beginning for Polygon!,sassal0x,[],[],186,1000,47
2021-09-01 08:41:42 UTC,"2/ In saying that, I'm excited for all the other things that the Polygon team are working on (Hermez, Avail, other L2 solutions) and I continue to support them.  But I will never purposefully mislead people about what any of their solutions are because I care about the truth.",sassal0x,[],[],1,74,6
2021-09-01 08:41:41 UTC,1/ I want to make it clear for everyone since I'm being attacked over this constantly.  I've never called the Polygon PoS chain a layer 2 scaling solution and I've explained to people numerous times that it's a sidechain/separate layer 1.,sassal0x,[],[],17,284,54
2021-09-01 08:37:57 UTC,That's fine and I get that - but just because I'm associated with Polygon doesn't mean that I condone everything that they do.  Banteg is implying that I called the PoS chain a layer 2 when I never have - that is just spreading lies.,sassal0x,[],[],1,3,4
2021-09-01 08:30:51 UTC,I've never called the PoS chain an L2 and I've constantly explained to people that it's a sidechain/separate blockchain (layer 1).  This is why I find it really weird that I get attacked over my affiliation with Polygon - I stick to the truth but apparently that doesn't matter?,sassal0x,[],[],0,15,10
2021-09-01 01:29:38 UTC,I didn't deny having a financial interest - I've disclosed it many times before - I was just adding some extra colour.  I don't think banteg meant it as a joke given his hostility towards Polygon over the last few months.,sassal0x,[],[],1,22,2
2021-09-01 01:19:01 UTC,I mean I don't know why I'm bothering to reply to this but here goes...  I have been supporting Polygon since mid-late 2019 (became an advisor in Jan 2021).  I've received no tokens so far and won't receive any for many months to come.  It's sad that I'm attacked like this.,sassal0x,[],[],1,109,10
