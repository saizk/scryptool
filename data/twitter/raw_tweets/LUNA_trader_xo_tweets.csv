2021-11-26 14:50:20 UTC,$LUNA - Ok so I got this wrong and I'm pleased to be wrong about this breaking down.  This has held up impressively well so far...  Encouraging - going to monitor this over the weekend.  https://t.co/0g0HtmFgqL,trader_xo,[],['luna'],12,140,15
2021-11-24 19:26:28 UTC,$LUNA - Not a great take - disappointed this didn't kick given the FA behind it.  If btc rolls over to 50-53k - most of the market will and and this tags $28's  Just being cautious.  https://t.co/WO3wKMyRIY,trader_xo,[],['luna'],15,179,16
2021-11-24 16:29:23 UTC,Luna I‚Äôm not bothered about price tbh I bought Luna for the lp pools and airdrops for the projects coming out.,trader_xo,[],[],0,3,1
2021-11-22 20:54:15 UTC,$LUNA &amp; $DOT  Just to reiterate are long term plays for me.  Deploying $DOT for crowdloans  Deploying $LUNA for the LP / rewards in other projects.  Not concerned about price what so ever regardless if it drops lower from here.  I can always hedge with a 1x short=delta neutral,trader_xo,[],"['luna', 'dot', 'dot', 'luna']",18,260,18
2021-11-21 15:34:00 UTC,"2022!   For now I‚Äôm content with my crypto exposure and have been consistently taking profits off the table on some of the plays I‚Äôve been in on for many months since July, August.   I‚Äôm looking forward to the Luna ecosystem and 150+ projects due to come out in December / 2022 Q1",trader_xo,[],[],10,138,6
2021-11-20 17:21:27 UTC,Understand the ecosystems and their network effects ahead of time.   Join the dots and you will have a clear macro narrative ahead of you.   The only exceptions missing in the list are $LUNA and $NEAR   #Cardano yet to be convinced.   Often early never late  Thanks ü§ù,trader_xo,['cardano'],"['luna', 'near']",19,115,18
2021-11-11 03:20:10 UTC,$LUNA  Keeping it simple - just playing the edges of the channels until it is no longer...  Almost 90 days in an uptrend...  https://t.co/KQTgQMXai2,trader_xo,[],['luna'],13,152,13
2021-11-10 19:05:03 UTC,I‚Äôd especially give focus to the Luna Ecosystem.   Approx 160 projects over the next 6 months.   *Network Effects*   Luna - shock supply ....   L-UST   etc etc...,trader_xo,[],[],14,122,9
2021-11-10 18:44:50 UTC,"So moving forward in terms of staking:   Entering polkadot crowdloans:   Really like the look of Acala, Moonbeam &amp; Astar  Luna - looking to play some LP/ staking for airdrops to new projects.

2021-11-09 18:08:57 UTC,This tweet makes 0 sense tbh...  My main reason for holding Dot and Luna is so that I can take part in the crowdloans and staking respectively.  Else its a completely different matter....  Not sure you understand the context,trader_xo,[],[],0,6,1
2021-11-09 17:28:47 UTC,"My average entries in $DOT and $LUNA are much lower down,.  Primarily keeping both - not too concerned about the price pulling back etc - can always hedge out with a short if shit hits the fan.

2021-10-16 21:07:09 UTC,$LUNA  Two levels of interest - immediate levels of interest around $32-34 if it holds.  Ideally would prefer the lower support level - still a considerable way out to contemplate at this stage....  https://t.co/VYyozVX9nf,trader_xo,[],['luna'],20,157,10
