2021-11-22 04:04:49 UTC,"He worked on Litecoin with me and Thrasher and Loshan for months! You think you know this better than I? When he came out with the UASF code, everyone only knew him as a Litecoin developer. How is this wrong?!",satoshilite,[],[],3,36,2
2021-11-22 03:59:53 UTC,"Yes, and Warren had said as much. Does that change the fact that he worked on Litecoin as Shaolinfry and was a Litecoin Core developer also?  Everyone else knew Shaolinfry as a Litecoin developer. Is that wrong?",satoshilite,[],[],1,26,2

2021-11-22 03:55:01 UTC,That doesn't change the fact that Litecoin was useful. To say every UASF supporter was a toxic Bitcoiner is false. I was out there pushing for UASF on Bitcoin also.,satoshilite,[],[],8,70,6

2021-10-08 19:05:15 UTC,"All this was just wrong. Users wanted SegWit. Markets wanted it. Why are miners, basically 1 person, able to block something that is good for Litecoin and Bitcoin.  In the end, miners are being paid to do one thing, which is to collect transactions into blocks and broadcast them.",satoshilite,[],[],7,101,1
2021-10-08 19:03:13 UTC,"Over the next week, more and more miners started signaling for SegWit and it started to look inevitable. And then this happened. Bitmain was building a ton of LTC miners and was going to turn them all on themselves to block the upgrade. 😡   https://t.co/Zvs9srExJJ",satoshilite,[],[],11,101,1
2021-10-08 18:59:09 UTC,"On April 1st, F2pool finally signaled SegWit for good this time. And of course the LTC price popped right afterwards. It was really hard for miners to deny that SegWit is good for Litecoin... at least for their pocketbooks.   https://t.co/uErfimIr7d",satoshilite,[],[],8,91,1
2021-10-08 18:55:33 UTC,"So over the next month, F2pool actually flipped flopped. They would signal and then stop signaling. The market reacted accordingly. When F2pool started signaling, the price will go up, and vice versa.  It became clear as day that the market wants Litecoin to get SegWit!",satoshilite,[],[],7,95,1
2021-10-08 18:48:03 UTC,"In February 2011, SegWit signaling started on Litecoin. Basically miners will signal whether or not they supported SegWit in the blocks they mined. If 75% of blocks signal for SegWit within a 2-week timeframe, it will lock and SegWit will activate after some time.",satoshilite,[],[],7,91,1
2021-10-08 18:43:43 UTC,Innosilicon was immediately on board with SegWit. They agreed with me that it's the best path forward. And they were able to convince some of their customers to support SegWit.  One of their customers was a huge LTC miner. He owned about 5% of the hashrate. Having him was huge.,satoshilite,[],[],9,101,1
2021-10-08 18:41:02 UTC,"A democracy is much less efficient but it's best for the long run as a benevolent dictator can easily turn bad.  Anyways, this was what I set out to do. I met and talked to many miners throughout the end of 2016 to early 2017. I talked to Innosilicon, another LTC ASIC maker.",satoshilite,[],[],11,118,1
2021-10-08 18:38:45 UTC,This makes it much harder for miners to block SegWit on Litecoin because they think that's best for Litecoin when I'm publicly saying the opposite. This is why a bit of centralization is more efficient. It's like the difference between a benevolent dictator and a democracy.,satoshilite,[],[],15,126,1
2021-10-08 18:37:07 UTC,"The difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin is me. Bitcoin is more decentralized. There's no one to come out to speak on what their vision of Bitcoin is.

2021-10-08 18:35:27 UTC,"Unfortunately that became very contentious. Because Jihan had a lot of influence, he single-handedly was able to block SegWit activation on Bitcoin.

2021-10-08 18:24:50 UTC,"Solving transaction malleability allows for the Lightning Network to function.  So SegWit fixes a major issue, increase block size by 2x, and allows for LN to scale Bitcoin/Litecoin even more. It's a win/win/win.

2021-10-08 01:16:24 UTC,"Before Namecoin switched to merged mining, it had a volatile hashrate where miners would all switch to Bitcoin. So there was a lot of block starvation at times. That's pretty much considered downtime when only a few blocks were mined a day.",satoshilite,[],[],1,20,1
2021-10-08 00:43:29 UTC,"In January of 2017, I wrote my vision about SegWit and LN on Litecoin and Bitcoin:  https://t.co/U6PWOfsYHk  But, man was it hard to get SegWit activated on Litecoin though. More later...",satoshilite,[],[],23,258,1
2021-10-08 00:41:59 UTC,Xinxi Wang () and Franklyn Richards () joined me as Director to the Litecoin Foundation and we had Loshan () and Thrasher () as developers working on the code.  People started to become excited about Litecoin again!,satoshilite,[],[],17,206,1

2021-10-08 00:37:45 UTC,"If SegWit is on Litecoin, there will be incentives for people to attack it. If miners can steal millions from anyone-can-spend coins, they would.

2021-10-08 00:36:17 UTC,"Testnet can test out the technical function of the blockchain but it can't test out the game theory of the blockchain. That's because there's no real value in testnet coins, so there's no reason for attackers to attack the chain if they can't profit from it. Litecoin changes that",satoshilite,[],[],15,175,1
2021-10-08 00:33:57 UTC,"I realized that here's a chance for Litecoin to do something to help Bitcoin. If we can get SegWit on Litecoin, it can clear out all the FUD and prove that SegWit is safe and a good upgrade for Bitcoin.  Back then the biggest FUD was the anyone-can-spend FUD.",satoshilite,[],[],14,186,1
2021-10-08 00:30:32 UTC,This was one of the reasons why I decided to take 3 months off from Coinbase in 2016 to focus my efforts back to Litecoin.  At the time SegWit was being pushed for Bitcoin and it was running into a lot of roadblocks. It was technically sound and a great upgrade for Bitcoin.,satoshilite,[],[],10,157,1
2021-10-08 00:28:34 UTC,"Although I went along with the plan, it kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Litecoin had a much higher global trade volume at the time and was the #2 coin in marketcap. So although it's fair that Ethereum had more potential, we went out of our way to not launch LTC at the same time.",satoshilite,[],[],9,163,1
2021-10-08 00:25:06 UTC,There was a lot of unsatisfied demand. People in the US had no easy way to store and trade these coins. And Coinbase would steal a lion share of the demand if we added the 2 coins to start.  Both Brian and Fred like the idea but they crossed out LTC. They just want to do ETH.,satoshilite,[],[],9,154,1
2021-10-08 00:22:56 UTC,This was also when Ethereum was starting to get big. So I put together a proposal to Brian and Fred Ehrsam () to add both LTC and ETH to Coinbase. Basically the reasoning was that it was clear that Coinbase could make a lot of money if it let people trade ETH and LTC.,satoshilite,[],[],9,162,1
2021-10-08 00:21:29 UTC,That changed though in 2016. The was when Litecoin trade volume exploded on Chinese exchanges and it was clear to me that Coinbase was leaving a lot of money on the table by not supporting altcoins. And it made business sense for Coinbase to add altcoins.,satoshilite,[],[],7,144,1
2021-10-08 00:16:11 UTC,"And I guess, unbeknownst to everyone else, he was also dealing with his exchange having lost thousands of BTC to hacks and bad code.

2021-10-08 00:12:59 UTC,"But at least he created a cool banner for it. 😁   https://t.co/7BToh7YNdX  After that, there were rumors of  finally adding its second coin, Litecoin.

2021-10-08 00:09:28 UTC,"In March of 2014,  finally added Litecoin support. BTCC was the first crypto exchange in China and at one point the largest. It was actually co-founder by my brother, Bobby Lee (), CEO of  now. Although it was a huge news, what took him so long?!",satoshilite,[],[],11,156,1
2021-10-08 00:06:34 UTC,"Coinbase was the hot startup and THE crypto company that is making Bitcoin easy to use. I knew that if Bitcoin didn't succeed, Litecoin wasn't going anywhere either.

2021-10-08 00:01:35 UTC,"It started with an email to Coinbase support to add Litecoin. Olaf Carlson-Wee (), Founder &amp; CEO of Polychain Capital now, was super friendly and the answer was the same: not now but maybe later?
