2021-10-17 21:17:50 UTC,Why would I sell ADA in my HODL portfolio? That is what my med risk portfolio is for. HODL portfolio is specifically for low risk cryptos that will slowly appreciate over the next 5-10 years. Come back when you understand of investing.,ladyofcrypto1,[],[],0,4,1,ADA

2021-09-21 20:18:33 UTC,Fundamental issues I have with ADA: - Slow to get anything done. They are outpaced by comp. - Plutus programming language isn't commonly used which makes programming dapps more difficult. Trying to find a plutus developer is harder. Great for Plutus devs but bad for dapp dev.,ladyofcrypto1,[],[],0,2,1,ADA
2021-09-21 20:06:34 UTC,I am bullish as long as Hoskinson can keep up the facade that it is better than its competition. ADA has world class marketing and the uninformed masses eat it up. In reality ADA is outclassed by its competition.,ladyofcrypto1,[],[],0,2,1,ADA
