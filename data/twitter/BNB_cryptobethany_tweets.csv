2021-11-25 09:46:16 UTC,I keep looking at other alts thinking they are doing as good as #bnb and game coins.  They are totally not.  Also $bifi is like the best DeFi coin out there. It's up like 20% from the dip.  Jees we picked the right ones this week.,cryptobethany,['bnb'],['bifi'],5,71,30
2021-11-25 09:00:15 UTC,"What's $sol doing rn?  There's been a pop to like $ftm, $matic, $bnb, $avax the past like 48 hrs.  But Solana is like idk, in struggle town.  Meme coin $ada is rekt.  This is crypto #5 &amp; #6 sucking rn.  Does it make human sense for Carbano to be ahead of avax - no.",cryptobethany,[],"['sol', 'ftm', 'matic', 'bnb', 'avax', 'ada']",2,51,13

2021-11-21 03:09:27 UTC,"Can everyone on CT plz buy $shib again.  Get shib ponzi pumped.  I bought some before bed and I'm down.  I wanna dump it already.  Last dog coin I touch omg wtf is the point in a dog coin, I want my money back and I wanna buy high quality #bnb with it.",cryptobethany,['bnb'],['shib'],3,66,35
2021-11-12 12:41:41 UTC,"Like Jonesy said.  Do A rumble feature.  Where many of us put in like 0.1 bnb or the $bash coin, then we run about bashing eachother.  The winner of the rumble takes all the coins.",cryptobethany,[],['bash'],0,13,7
2021-10-12 17:17:25 UTC,"I don't think it is that, they are hujacking every binance tweet and I doubt nance would do videos for a new coin.",cryptobethany,[],[],0,2,1
2021-10-12 17:15:19 UTC,They wouldn't do video teasers for coin listings.  They never give any hint whatsoever about coin listings.  This is a new binance product IMHO.,cryptobethany,[],[],0,2,0
2021-09-30 17:54:37 UTC,"A higher priced chain coin like eth/bnb/sol/matic.t.c.  Yields better NFT trading margins.  Like regardless of supply/market cap e.t.c.  If the chains coin is a higher price for 1 coin vs 1 coin.  It's psychological or something, but seems to cause better yields trading NFTs.",cryptobethany,[],[],1,24,11
2021-09-20 07:23:26 UTC,"Trading NFT's on #bsc should have better profit margins than $sol, because the fees are higher makes ppl think &amp; #bnb is also a higher cost coin.  With that naturally seems to come better margins.  + 0.1 $sol = $14 + 0.1 $bnb =$40  Psychology.  Also 2.3m active PCS users...",cryptobethany,"['bsc', 'bnb']","['sol', 'sol', 'bnb']",5,54,15
2021-09-07 01:05:14 UTC,Omg I found out nance had $sol coin futures like we did with #bnb   Just had to long it &amp; take extra coins off bears.  Mine now üòù  https://t.co/ovaaizgZDE,cryptobethany,['bnb'],['sol'],0,34,8
