2021-11-30 22:51:15 UTC,That's the issue. They cannot admit they are wrong. We literally have stuff running on mainnet with millions of dollars of ada moving everyday and they cannot admit it. It's bizarre and sad. CDS (cardano derangement syndrome),iohk_charles,[],[],23,186,16
2021-11-29 18:14:58 UTC,The ETH community has been publicly shitting on Cardano for years from hit piece books to character assassination over social media every day. Haven't you been paying attention?,iohk_charles,[],[],12,174,9
2021-11-29 18:10:57 UTC,The Cardano ecosystem continues to innovate in every category including project financing. ISPOs are a unique way of building support for a project  https://t.co/fhDbFu4dqY,iohk_charles,[],[],575,3273,142

2021-11-28 22:44:47 UTC,And they are terrified because there doesn't need to be some magical Cardano 2 to survive. It's a future proof design and we are systematically building towards it together with the strongest and most engaged community brick by brick,iohk_charles,[],[],1429,7094,462
2021-11-28 20:06:02 UTC,Welcome baby cardano to the world,iohk_charles,[],[],694,8417,496
2021-11-27 20:41:04 UTC,That's not us. Different Cardano,iohk_charles,[],[],2,18,6
2021-11-27 17:27:01 UTC,Cardano is open for business. No one is waiting on the PAB. You're being lied to by FUD. People are actively building with the testnet PAB. It takes time to build a DApp.,iohk_charles,[],[],33,234,24
2021-11-26 20:43:59 UTC,"Client diversity is critical for the ling term viability of Cardano. I'd love to see a typescript, rust, and Haskell client all working together and certified against the formal specifications",iohk_charles,[],[],270,2277,182
2021-11-23 23:03:54 UTC,And we didn't even get delisted. Ada is still on etoro and non-US customers can freely trade,iohk_charles,[],[],913,5484,510
2021-11-23 15:05:39 UTC,"I truly enjoy that the narrative about Cardano is changing from Ghostchain with no use and utility to ""how will Cardano handle all this congestion? Blocks are full!!!!

2021-11-21 18:16:07 UTC,"So many lies on that episode. Cardano was never a gambling coin, there are tons of ventures on cardano  https://t.co/4Ywrz9NGM4, ""PhD Graveyard"", it was one long list of lies and FUD. But that's what we can now expect from CB.",iohk_charles,[],[],3,23,8
2021-11-19 19:53:50 UTC,There is no giant pool of unassigned ada. Every Lovelace belongs to someone just like Bitcoin. So who do you want to steal from do you can get a small return? Give me specific people,iohk_charles,[],[],4,60,8
2021-11-19 19:04:32 UTC,Cardano has a deflationary monetary policy like Bitcoin. It has had the same policy since the beginning. That's the social contract everyone signed up for and it won't change,iohk_charles,[],[],34,408,20
2021-11-19 19:01:27 UTC,"I don't get a say. The community controls cardano. If you guys want to destroy the monetary policy of cardano and be no better than the federal reserve, then I'll be happy to leave for another project that has principles",iohk_charles,[],[],15,397,54
2021-11-16 20:21:56 UTC,Here's a great blog post on how to write concurrency smart contracts on Cardano  https://t.co/IJrEWiDnr1 with some code examples,iohk_charles,[],[],376,1917,74
2021-11-15 14:38:21 UTC,"No, I'm not and there is no reality where I ever could be. Bitcoin is a reflection of the thinking that came from the 80s and 90s. It's the capstone of the cyperpunk movement. Cardano is how I think about cryptocurrencies and it's for the 21st century",iohk_charles,[],[],143,1924,60

2021-11-12 14:04:12 UTC,"I'm really loving how the roadmap for 2022 Cardano is coming together. It's a living ecosystem, growing, refining, adapting, and becoming stronger. The technology is unbelievable and we have so many great innovations coming to meet the hundreds of projects building on Cardano",iohk_charles,[],[],1959,12135,561

2021-11-05 16:38:22 UTC,PAB is moving along quite well. It's going to be one heck of a trial by fire after it ships with all the devs hammering it. I'm amazed at how quickly the Cardano Ecosystem is growing and coming together,iohk_charles,[],[],490,2971,164

2021-09-18 01:40:35 UTC,No they aren't easy and it just shows you how ignorant the critics are. Sealing a deal in Africa like we did was the accomplishment of a lifetime for a startup,iohk_charles,[],[],5,81,8
2021-09-17 18:04:55 UTC,No they don't. You can never win. There will always be the next book and article. You win by changing the game. This isn't about being liked or praised. It's about changing people's lives. Win by doing that. Use cardano to do that and it's over,iohk_charles,[],[],69,539,40
2021-09-17 18:00:15 UTC,"You guys should just stop engaging. The world is too big to be concerned with these things. We have a massive ecosystem, smart contracts, Africa, and the mission to worry about. Let journalists write fiction books about something a decade ago. Attacking me != attacking Cardano",iohk_charles,[],[],62,634,46
2021-09-17 00:56:09 UTC,Playing around with the Cardano Summit. Yes we did build a complete online world on the back of a turtle just to showcase cardano. You're welcome  https://t.co/rDsg4ILwri,iohk_charles,[],[],320,3221,165

2021-09-11 04:32:35 UTC,"Cardano Derangement Syndrome at its finest. CDS is a progressive disorder that slowly destroys the sufferer's ability to decern reality.
