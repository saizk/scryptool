2021-10-08 00:36:17 UTC,"Testnet can test out the technical function of the blockchain but it can't test out the game theory of the blockchain. That's because there's no real value in testnet coins, so there's no reason for attackers to attack the chain if they can't profit from it. Litecoin changes that",satoshilite,[],[],15,175,1,LTC
2021-10-08 00:33:57 UTC,"I realized that here's a chance for Litecoin to do something to help Bitcoin. If we can get SegWit on Litecoin, it can clear out all the FUD and prove that SegWit is safe and a good upgrade for Bitcoin.  Back then the biggest FUD was the anyone-can-spend FUD.",satoshilite,[],[],14,186,1,LTC
2021-10-08 00:30:32 UTC,This was one of the reasons why I decided to take 3 months off from Coinbase in 2016 to focus my efforts back to Litecoin.  At the time SegWit was being pushed for Bitcoin and it was running into a lot of roadblocks. It was technically sound and a great upgrade for Bitcoin.,satoshilite,[],[],10,157,1,LTC
2021-10-08 00:28:34 UTC,"Although I went along with the plan, it kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Litecoin had a much higher global trade volume at the time and was the #2 coin in marketcap. So although it's fair that Ethereum had more potential, we went out of our way to not launch LTC at the same time.",satoshilite,[],[],9,163,1,LTC
2021-10-08 00:25:06 UTC,There was a lot of unsatisfied demand. People in the US had no easy way to store and trade these coins. And Coinbase would steal a lion share of the demand if we added the 2 coins to start.  Both Brian and Fred like the idea but they crossed out LTC. They just want to do ETH.,satoshilite,[],[],9,154,1,LTC
2021-10-08 00:22:56 UTC,This was also when Ethereum was starting to get big. So I put together a proposal to Brian and Fred Ehrsam () to add both LTC and ETH to Coinbase. Basically the reasoning was that it was clear that Coinbase could make a lot of money if it let people trade ETH and LTC.,satoshilite,[],[],9,162,1,LTC
2021-10-08 00:21:29 UTC,That changed though in 2016. The was when Litecoin trade volume exploded on Chinese exchanges and it was clear to me that Coinbase was leaving a lot of money on the table by not supporting altcoins. And it made business sense for Coinbase to add altcoins.,satoshilite,[],[],7,144,1,LTC
2021-10-08 00:16:11 UTC,"And I guess, unbeknownst to everyone else, he was also dealing with his exchange having lost thousands of BTC to hacks and bad code.

2021-10-08 00:01:35 UTC,"It started with an email to Coinbase support to add Litecoin.

2021-10-07 20:07:10 UTC,I remember thinking to myself that one day they will add Litecoin. And it will be because it was the right business decision for them to add LTC.  And that did happen but 4 years later in June of 2017:  https://t.co/k2jOW7bvGp,satoshilite,[],[],21,317,1,LTC

2021-10-07 19:56:31 UTC,"Soon after the launch, Litecoin was added to BTC-e. That helped a lot as miners had access to liquidity pretty quickly.
