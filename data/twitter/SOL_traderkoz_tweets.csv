2021-09-17 16:21:55 UTC,$SOL  Solana is following the bearish case that we were talking about on stream yesterday.  We just took out all those lows in the mid-130s and now I'm looking for it to push higher.  Flip 150 and I'd feel very confident we see 175  https://t.co/fgJSxDkv86,traderkoz,[],['sol'],9,109,8
